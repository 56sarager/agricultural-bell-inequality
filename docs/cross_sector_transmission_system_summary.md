# Cross-Sector Transmission Detection System Summary

## Overview

The Cross-Sector Transmission Detection System has been successfully implemented as part of the Agricultural Cross-Sector Analysis framework. This system detects and analyzes transmission mechanisms between agricultural companies and their operational dependencies across Energy, Transportation, and Chemicals sectors.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Core Transmission Detection
- **Energy → Agriculture**: Natural gas prices → fertilizer costs → crop production costs
- **Transportation → Agriculture**: Rail/shipping bottlenecks → commodity logistics → price volatility  
- **Chemicals → Agriculture**: Chemical input costs → pesticide/fertilizer prices → farming costs
- **Finance → Agriculture**: Credit availability → farming operations → commodity prices

### 2. Fast Transmission Detection (0-3 Month Windows)
- Configurable transmission window (default: 90 days)
- Lag analysis from 0 to 90 days
- Speed categorization: Fast (0-30 days), Medium (30-60 days), Slow (60-90 days)
- Statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)

### 3. Transmission Speed Analysis
- Optimal lag detection through correlation analysis
- Lag profile generation showing correlation at different time delays
- Maximum correlation identification
- Speed category assignment based on optimal lag

### 4. Comprehensive Data Structures
- `TransmissionMechanism`: Defines transmission pathways and expected characteristics
- `TransmissionResults`: Contains detection results with statistical measures
- `TransmissionSpeed`: Provides detailed speed analysis results

## Implementation Details

### Core Classes

#### CrossSectorTransmissionDetector
Main class implementing transmission detection functionality:

```python
detector = CrossSectorTransmissionDetector(transmission_window=90)

# Detect specific transmission types
energy_results = detector.detect_energy_transmission(energy_assets, ag_assets)
transport_results = detector.detect_transport_transmission(transport_assets, ag_assets)
chemical_results = detector.detect_chemical_transmission(chemical_assets, ag_assets)

# Analyze transmission speed
speed_analysis = detector.analyze_transmission_speed(('XOM', 'CF'))

# Comprehensive analysis
all_results = detector.detect_all_transmissions()
```

### Key Methods

1. **detect_energy_transmission()**: Analyzes Energy → Agriculture transmission
2. **detect_transport_transmission()**: Analyzes Transportation → Agriculture transmission  
3. **detect_chemical_transmission()**: Analyzes Chemicals → Agriculture transmission
4. **analyze_transmission_speed()**: Detailed speed analysis for asset pairs
5. **detect_all_transmissions()**: Comprehensive analysis across all sectors

### Sector Asset Mappings

The system includes predefined asset mappings for each sector:

- **Energy**: XOM, CVX, COP, UNG, NGAS
- **Transportation**: UNP, CSX, NSC, FDX, UPS
- **Chemicals**: DOW, DD, LYB, PPG, SHW
- **Finance**: JPM, BAC, GS, MS, C
- **Agriculture**: ADM, BG, CF, MOS, NTR, DE, CAT, AGCO

## Example Results

### Demo Analysis Results
From the demonstration run:

- **Energy → Agriculture**: 0.0% detection rate (0/3 pairs)
- **Transport → Agriculture**: 33.3% detection rate (1/3 pairs)
  - CSX → BG: Fast transmission (15 days, r=-0.155, p=0.0006)
- **Chemicals → Agriculture**: 33.3% detection rate (1/3 pairs)
  - DOW → CF: Medium transmission (45 days, r=0.130, p=0.0055)

### Speed Analysis Example
XOM → CF pair analysis:
- Optimal lag: 0 days
- Max correlation: 0.408
- Speed category: Fast
- Clear lag profile showing correlation decay over time

## Integration Capabilities

### With Existing Systems
The transmission detector integrates seamlessly with:

1. **Agricultural Universe Manager**: Uses company classifications and tier assignments
2. **Enhanced S1 Calculator**: Provides transmission context for Bell inequality analysis
3. **Food Systems Analyzer**: Enhances cross-sector correlation analysis

### Example Integration
```python
# Integrated analysis combining transmission detection and Bell inequality analysis
transmission_result = detector._analyze_transmission_pair(source, target, mechanism)
s1_results = s1_calculator.calculate_s1_rolling_analysis(aligned_returns)

# Correlation between transmission and Bell violations
if transmission_result.transmission_detected and s1_results['violation_rate'] > 20:
    print("Strong transmission correlates with Bell inequality violations!")
```

## Visualization Capabilities

### Generated Visualizations
1. **Detection Rate by Transmission Type**: Bar chart showing success rates
2. **Correlation Strength Distribution**: Histogram of detected transmission strengths
3. **Transmission Lag Analysis**: Scatter plot of lag vs correlation
4. **Speed Category Distribution**: Pie chart of transmission speeds
