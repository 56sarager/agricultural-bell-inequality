# Food Systems Quantum Correlation Research Steering

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Research Objective
Detect and analyze quantum-like correlations in global food systems using Bell inequality tests for **Science journal publication**.

## ðŸŒ¾ Food Systems Focus Areas

### Core Food Commodities
- **Grains**: CORN, WEAT, SOYB, RICE (staple crops)
- **Livestock**: LEAN (hogs), cattle futures, dairy
- **Soft Commodities**: SUGA, COFF, COCO (climate-sensitive)
- **Agricultural ETFs**: DBA, CORN, WEAT, SOYB

### Food System Companies
- **Processors**: ADM (Archer Daniels Midland), BG (Bunge), CAG (ConAgra)
- **Food Giants**: GIS (General Mills), K (Kellogg), KHC (Kraft Heinz)
- **Fertilizer**: CF (CF Industries), MOS (Mosaic), NTR (Nutrien)
- **Equipment**: DE (John Deere), CAT (Caterpillar), AGCO

### Supply Chain Logic
- **CORN-LEAN**: Corn prices directly affect livestock feed costs
- **ADM-CORN**: ADM processes corn into food products
- **CF-CORN**: CF provides nitrogen fertilizer for corn production
- **DE-CORN**: Deere equipment used for corn farming

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Methodology

### Bell Inequality Approach
- Use **S1 conditional Bell inequality** following Zarifian et al. (2025)
- **Cumulative returns** (critical for detecting violations)
- **Sign-based binary outcomes** (-1, 0, +1)
- **Absolute return thresholds** for regime detection

### Expected Results
- **Supply chain pairs**: 20-35% violation rates
- **Climate-sensitive pairs**: 25-40% violation rates  
- **Crisis periods**: 40-60% violation rates
- **Cross-sector pairs**: 10-20% violation rates

## ðŸ”¬ Science Publication Strategy

### Key Scientific Contributions
1. **First detection** of quantum effects in food systems
2. **Non-local correlations** in agricultural supply chains
3. **Crisis amplification** of quantum effects
4. **Food security implications** of quantum correlations

### Publication Angle
- **Title**: "Quantum Entanglement in Global Food Systems: Bell Inequality Violations Reveal Non-Local Correlations"
- **Significance**: New paradigm for understanding food system vulnerabilities
- **Applications**: Crisis prediction, supply chain optimization, food security

### Target Metrics for Science
- **Statistical significance**: p < 0.001 for all major findings
- **Effect size**: 20-60% above classical bounds
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent across time periods and crises
- **Global relevance**: Analysis covers major food-producing regions

## ðŸ“‰ Priority Crisis Periods

### COVID-19 Food Disruption (2020)
- **Period**: March 2020 - December 2020
- **Focus**: Supply chain disruptions, panic buying, restaurant closures
- **Expected**: High Bell violations due to synchronized disruptions

### Ukraine War Food Crisis (2022-2023)
- **Period**: February 2022 - Present
- **Focus**: Global grain export disruptions (Ukraine = breadbasket)
- **Expected**: Extreme Bell violations in grain markets

### 2012 US Drought
- **Period**: June 2012 - December 2012
- **Focus**: Severe drought in US corn/soybean belt
- **Expected**: Strong quantum correlations across affected crops

### 2008 Global Food Price Crisis
- **Period**: December 2007 - December 2008
- **Focus**: Global food riots, export restrictions
- **Expected**: System-wide Bell violations

## ðŸŽ¯ WDRS Data Strategy

### Priority Assets for WDRS Download
Based on Yahoo Finance results, focus on:
1. **Top violating food pairs** (e.g., CORN-LEAN, ADM-CORN)
2. **Crisis period data** (2008 food crisis, 2020 COVID, 2022 Ukraine)
3. **Extended time series** (10+ years for robust statistics)
4. **High-frequency data** (daily â†’ hourly â†’ tick-by-tick)

### WDRS Analysis Timeline
1. **Phase 1**: Yahoo Finance validation (current)
2. **Phase 2**: WDRS daily data (2-3 years key periods)
3. **Phase 3**: WDRS high-frequency (crisis periods)
4. **Phase 4**: Publication preparation

## ðŸ’¡ Research Hypotheses

### H1: Supply Chain Entanglement
Food companies and their input commodities exhibit Bell inequality violations due to direct business relationships.

### H2: Climate Synchronization  
Weather-sensitive crops show quantum-like correlations due to shared climate drivers.

### H3: Crisis Amplification
Food crises dramatically increase Bell violation rates through system-wide stress.

### H4: Seasonal Quantum Effects
Agricultural seasons modulate quantum correlation strength.

### H5: Geographic Non-Locality
Food crises create non-local correlations across geographically distant markets.

## ðŸ”¬ Analysis Parameters

### Standard Settings
- **Window size**: 20 periods (optimal for food data)
- **Threshold quantile**: 0.75 (captures extreme price moves)
- **Data frequency**: Daily (sufficient for food market analysis)
- **Minimum data**: 100+ observations per asset

### Crisis Period Settings
- **Window size**: 15 periods (shorter for crisis analysis)
- **Threshold quantile**: 0.8 (higher threshold for extreme events)
- **Focus on**: High-volatility periods with supply disruptions

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Statistical Requirements
- **p < 0.001** for all major Bell violations
- **Bootstrap validation** with 1000+ resamples
- **Cross-validation** across time periods
- **Robustness testing** across parameters

### Science Publication Requirements
- **Novel discovery**: First quantum effects in food systems
- **Global impact**: Affects food security worldwide
- **Policy relevance**: Tools for crisis prediction
- **Reproducible**: Open-source code and data

Always prioritize food system relationships and Science publication quality in analysis and interpretation.
