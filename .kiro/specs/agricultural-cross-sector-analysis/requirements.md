# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing food systems Bell inequality analysis to focus specifically on agricultural companies and their cross-sectoral dependencies. The analysis will examine quantum-like correlations between agricultural companies and their operational dependencies across three tiers: direct operational dependencies (Energy, Transportation, Chemicals), major cost drivers (Banking/Finance, Equipment Manufacturing), and policy-linked sectors (Renewable Energy, Water Utilities). The primary focus will be on Tier 1 sectors with fast transmission mechanisms (0-3 months) to detect rapid correlation propagation during market stress periods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a food systems researcher, I want to analyze cross-sectoral Bell inequality violations between agricultural companies and their operational dependencies, so that I can identify non-local correlations that indicate systemic vulnerabilities in food supply chains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes agricultural-energy pairs THEN it SHALL detect Bell inequality violations with statistical significance p < 0.001
2. WHEN energy price shocks occur THEN the system SHALL identify correlation transmission to fertilizer companies within 0-3 months
3. WHEN analyzing Tier 1 dependencies THEN the system SHALL include Energy (natural gas for fertilizer, diesel for equipment), Transportation (rail/shipping), and Chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers)
4. IF Bell violations exceed 25% above classical bounds THEN the system SHALL flag these as significant cross-sectoral entanglement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher preparing for Science journal publication, I want comprehensive statistical validation of agricultural cross-sector correlations, so that I can demonstrate the first detection of quantum effects in agricultural supply chains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing statistical analysis THEN the system SHALL use bootstrap validation with 1000+ resamples
2. WHEN calculating Bell inequality violations THEN the system SHALL use the S1 conditional approach following Zarifian et al. (2025) with exact formula: S1 = ⟨ab⟩00 + ⟨ab⟩01 + ⟨ab⟩10 - ⟨ab⟩11
3. WHEN computing conditional expectations THEN the system SHALL use ⟨ab⟩xy = Σ[sign(RA,t)sign(RB,t)I{|RA,t|≥rA}I{|RB,t|≥rB}] / Σ[I{|RA,t|≥rA}I{|RB,t|≥rB}] for each regime
4. WHEN analyzing crisis periods THEN the system SHALL focus on COVID-19 (2020), Ukraine War (2022-2023), and 2008 food crisis
5. IF violation rates exceed 40% during crisis periods THEN the system SHALL document this as crisis amplification evidence

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to organize agricultural companies by market cap and exposure level, so that I can systematically analyze the most relevant cross-sectoral relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categorizing companies THEN the system SHALL classify by Large-Cap (>$10B), Mid-Cap ($2B-$10B), and Small-Cap ($250M-$2B)
2. WHEN assigning exposure levels THEN the system SHALL use Primary (direct agricultural operations), Secondary (significant agricultural exposure), and Tertiary (indirect exposure)
3. WHEN selecting analysis pairs THEN the system SHALL prioritize Primary exposure companies for cross-sectoral analysis
4. IF a company has direct operational dependencies THEN the system SHALL include it in Tier 1 analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a food security analyst, I want to examine transmission mechanisms between sectors, so that I can understand how shocks propagate through agricultural supply chains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing energy-agriculture transmission THEN the system SHALL examine natural gas prices → fertilizer costs → crop production costs
2. WHEN studying transportation effects THEN the system SHALL analyze rail/shipping bottlenecks → commodity logistics → price volatility
3. WHEN examining financial sector stress THEN the system SHALL track agricultural credit availability → farming operations → commodity prices
4. IF transmission occurs within 0-3 months THEN the system SHALL classify it as fast transmission

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to implement robust data handling for the comprehensive agricultural universe, so that I can ensure reliable analysis across all company tiers and sectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading data THEN the system SHALL handle the complete agricultural universe of 60+ companies
2. WHEN processing time series THEN the system SHALL use daily frequency data with minimum 100 observations per asset
3. WHEN calculating returns THEN the system SHALL use daily returns Ri,t = (Pi,t - Pi,t-1) / Pi,t-1 as specified in Zarifian et al. (2025)
4. WHEN applying rolling windows THEN the system SHALL use window size w with endpoints T ranging from w to N (total observations)
5. IF data quality issues exist THEN the system SHALL implement robust error handling and data validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want clear visualization and reporting of cross-sectoral relationships, so that I can communicate findings effectively for Science journal publication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating visualizations THEN the system SHALL create sector-specific heatmaps showing Bell violation rates
2. WHEN producing reports THEN the system SHALL include statistical significance testing and effect sizes
3. WHEN documenting results THEN the system SHALL organize findings by tier (Tier 1: Energy/Transport/Chemicals, Tier 2: Finance/Equipment, Tier 3: Policy-linked)
4. IF significant violations are found THEN the system SHALL generate publication-ready figures and tables

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want to ensure mathematical accuracy of the S1 Bell inequality implementation, so that results are scientifically valid and reproducible according to Zarifian et al. (2025).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating binary indicators THEN the system SHALL use I{|RA,t| ≥ rA} where rA is the threshold for strong price movements
2. WHEN determining sign outcomes THEN the system SHALL use Sign(Ri,t) = +1 if Ri,t ≥ 0, -1 if Ri,t < 0
3. WHEN computing regime classifications THEN the system SHALL use four regimes: (x0,y0), (x0,y1), (x1,y0), (x1,y1) based on threshold crossings
4. WHEN handling missing data THEN the system SHALL set ⟨ab⟩xy = 0 if no valid observations exist for that regime
5. IF |S1| > 2 THEN the system SHALL count this as a Bell inequality violation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a food systems researcher, I want to focus analysis on crisis periods and seasonal effects, so that I can understand when cross-sectoral quantum correlations are strongest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing crisis periods THEN the system SHALL use shorter window sizes (15 periods) and higher thresholds (0.8 quantile)
2. WHEN examining seasonal effects THEN the system SHALL account for agricultural planting/harvest cycles
3. WHEN studying geographic effects THEN the system SHALL consider regional agricultural production patterns
4. IF seasonal modulation exists THEN the system SHALL document quantum correlation strength variations throughout the year
